# ScalaCheck: Property-based testing for Scala

ScalaCheck is a library written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and
used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs.
ScalaCheck was originally inspired by the Haskell library
[QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck), but has also
ventured into its own.

ScalaCheck has no external dependencies other than the Scala runtime, and
[works](/download.html#sbt) great with [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/), the
Scala build tool. It is also fully integrated in the test frameworks
[ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/),
[specs2](https://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) and
[LambdaTest](https://github.com/47deg/LambdaTest). You can also use ScalaCheck
completely standalone, with its built-in test runner.

ScalaCheck is used by several prominent Scala projects, for example the [Scala
compiler](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and the [Akka](https://akka.io/)
concurrency framework.

   organisation. See the [release notes](\$repoUrl\$/releases/tag/1.14.1).

   with Scala 2.12.0. Also, as a problem was discovered with the
   previously released ScalaCheck 1.12.5 build, it is recommended that you
   upgrade to 1.12.6 or 1.13.4 even if you're not using Scala 2.12.

 * 2015-09-10: Snapshot builds are no longer published on this site.
   Instead [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/rickynils/scalacheck)
   automatically publishes all successful builds of the master branch.
   See [documentation](/download.html#snapshot) for more information.

## Quick start { #quickstart }

Specify some of the methods of `java.lang.String` like this:

```scala
import org.scalacheck.Properties
import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll

object StringSpecification extends Properties("String") {

  property("startsWith") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a+b).startsWith(a)
  }

  property("concatenate") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a+b).length > a.length && (a+b).length > b.length
  }

  property("substring") = forAll { (a: String, b: String, c: String) =>
    (a+b+c).substring(a.length, a.length+b.length) == b
  }

}
```

If you use [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) add the following dependency to
your build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "$currentVer$" % "test"
```

Put your ScalaCheck properties in `src/test/scala`, then use the `test` task to
check them:

```
$$ sbt test
+ String.startsWith: OK, passed 100 tests.
! String.concat: Falsified after 0 passed tests.
> ARG_0: ""
> ARG_1: ""
+ String.substring: OK, passed 100 tests.
```

As you can see, the second property was not quite right. ScalaCheck discovers
this and presents the arguments that make the property fail, two empty strings.
The other two properties both pass 100 test rounds, each with a randomized set
of input parameters.

You can also use ScalaCheck standalone, since it has a built-in command line
test runner. Compile and run like this:

```
$$ scalac -cp scalacheck_$scalaVer$-$currentVer$.jar StringSpecification.scala

$$ scala -cp .:scalacheck_$scalaVer$-$currentVer$.jar StringSpecification
```
